# sure_creditCard_pdfParse
A secure, offline Streamlit app that extracts key data from Indian credit card statements (SBI, HDFC, ICICI, IDFC, Axis). Supports password-protected PDFs, detects card number, total due, minimum due, due date, and available credit — using regex + layout parsing. No APIs. No data leaves your machine.
